The tornado touched down at 330 PM one mile west of Charlotte Pike and I-440.  A tree fell on an ROTC student at Centennial Park. He was attending an ROTC picnic. He died later on May 4 from his injuries.  The tornado went through downtown Nashville at 340 PM and on toward East Nashville, Donelson and Hermitage. The tornado blew out many windows on office buildings. The Nations Bank Office Towers were one of the hardest hit buildings in Nashville.  Tennessee Performance Arts Center (TPAC) and the Tennessee Towers  sustained damage. TPAC had over 100 windows blown out. NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts from the Tennessee Towers and was off the air for about 24 hours. 30 private airplanes were damaged at Cornelia Fort Airport. Estimated damage to the airplanes was 3 million dollars.  35 buildings in downtown Nashville were "red tagged", meaning these buildings were structurally unsound.  Many signs in Davidson county were blown down or severely damaged. The tornado blew down 3 out of 10 construction cranes on the construction site of the Tennessee Oiler's Football Stadium near the Cumberland River. The tornado continued east and hit the residential section of East Nashville. At least 300 homes were damaged in East Nashville. Many homes lost a good part of their roofs, trees were uprooted, telephone poles were knocked down. St. Ann's  Episcopal Church, which is well over 100 years old, received major damage. Uprooted trees, damaged roofs to many homes was the story across Donelson and Hermitage. Numerous windows were blown out from the Gaylord Building in Donelson. About half the trees, that is over a thousand trees, were blown down at Andrew Jackson's home, The Hermitage. The Hermitage is a 600 acre estate of the former President. Some of those trees were well over 200 years old, and a few of those trees that were destroyed were planted by Andrew Jackson himself. Mayor Phil Bredesen closed downtown Nashville of Friday, April 17. Many workers had an unscheduled holiday. The downtown area was reopened Monday, April 20. This gave time for cleanup crews to remove broken glass and repair downed power lines.  Nashville Electric Service said 75,000 customers were without power.","",172

There was as much as 8 inches of snow in Gallatin and 7 inches at the NWS Office at Old Hickory. Specific amounts as of 4 PM were:

GALLATIN         8 INCHES (SPOTTER)

GAINESBORO       5 INCHES (SPOTTER)

CLARKSVILLE      4 INCHES (SPOTTER)

NWS OLD HICKORY  7.0 INCHES. This amount at NWS OLD HICKORY ties the record snowfall for January 16. 

Downtown Nashville had 7 inches of snow by 145 PM CST.  7 inches of snowfall was recorded in Nashville on January 16, 1948.  

The snow began to fall in the Metro Nashville area  around 8 AM. The snow shut down the city with schools, businesses and government agencies shutting down early. Motorists were stranded in slow-moving or non-moving traffic.  It took hours to get cross town. Tracker trailer trucks could not move on the interstates or jack-knifed, which resulted in grid lock. Since schools let out early, parents rushed to pick them up. Schools closed at 9 AM, right in the middle of the storm. Many school buses were stranded in the snow and some students didn't get home until 10 PM. At one point, 60 busues were stranded throughout the city. Also, some students were kept in schools with food, heat and water. Other students were sent home with teachers or school officials with 4 wheel drive vehicles.  Parents were angry because students were either kept at school or because their child had to ride in 4 wheel drive vehicles with strangers. 

I-65 was backed up for 5 hours from Nashville to the Kentucky border.  A newspaper story stated that many motorists had to relieve themselves in their vehicles because of the grid lock.",314

The heat has increased the death process. Loss of inventory or sales will result in buyers going elsewhere. Tennessee may not recover from all of this for 5 to 8 years. Seed on trees have been killed, and this has limit replanting; dogwoods have lost 3 yrs out of their cycle.  ||Older dogwood trees are stressed but living at the moment. A lack of moisture, with a deficit of 12 inches, coupled with record heat at the moment, has stressed out vegetation. There is little irrigation potential across board. ||The drought was in full swing by Mid-March, and by the end of June, many locations are running at least 10 inches below normal rainfall. All of Middle Tennessee has been classified in a drought with the southern tier of counties classified in a Severe Drought.||Cherry Creek Nursery in Cookeville has seen 40% of trees planted this spring die from lack of water. Cherry Creek Nursery lost one million dollars worth of Japanese maple trees to the late spring hard freeze. A vegetable farmer in Ridgetop, TN has been running pumps to move water to his fields for 16-hour days. This costs $300-500 a week. Some hard hit crops are winter wheat and hay, soybeans and tobacco. The first half of 2007 may be among the top five driest ever recorded in Middle Tennessee. The driest year was in 1941.||Many farmers are buying hay from other farmers at 3 times the normal price. Corn production was down 50 percent in Sumner County. Forage hay is 1/3 of what it should be. The poor hay production has affected the state's livestock sector. Poor pasture conditions and reduced hay production has caused farmers to sell off part of their herds.||State Department of Agricultural Commissioner Ken Givens said hay production is down 50-80 percent, and three-fourths of the state's pasture last week were rated in bad condition. The growth of soybeans and corn has been stunted. ||Winter wheat yield is projected to be one half of last year's record yield, which brought in $42.6 million. ||So far, agricultural losses in Coffee County has reached $10 million since the beginning of the drought. ||Commercial wineries will have to rely on imported grapes. The late spring hard freeze and drought has dried up locally grown grapes. |About 30 commercial wineries produce between $7 and $8 million of wine each year, but the University of Tennessee's plant sciences professor David Lockwood expects an 80% crop loss this year. ||On June 15, all Tennessee Counties were designated primary disaster areas because of losses caused by the drought.
