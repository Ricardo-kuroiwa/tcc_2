As a cold front moved slowly east, a wave of low pressure developed along the Southeast U.S. Coast and moved slowly north as a 
large area of high pressure off the New England Coast remained nearly stationary.  Abundant moisture from the remnants of tropical system Tammy over the Southeast also interacted with and converged north along this front.
