The tornado's path was intermittent for the first three and one-half miles then became continuous from S.W. 67 Street and 123 Avenue to where it lifted, on the north side of S.W. 24 Street and 93 Court. From its initial touchdown until it crossed Westwood Lake, intensity was rated as F0, with minor roof damage and downed trees and fences. Near S.W. 42 Street and 108 Avenue, the tornado intensified to a strong category F1, with wind gusts estimated around 110 mph, and it maintained this intensity until lifting. Throughout its lifetime, the tornado moved on a northeast track at a forward speed of 35 mph. Along the F1 portion of the track, nine persons were injured, three requiring hospitalization. Two of the more serious injuries occurred when the victim's cars were rolled. Major damage occurred to 26 buildings, mostly residences, but two churches, a lumber yard and a strip shopping center also sustained damaged. Another 50 buildings sustained minor damage.

Total damage from Floyd in south Florida is estimated at $100 thousand, most of which was in Palm Beach county.  This figure does not include preparation costs which were estimated to have been near $3 million in Palm Beach County alone.  

The observed maximum sustained wind on land was 37 mph with a gust to 56 mph at Lake Worth  Pier with most areas reporting maximum sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph.  The winds caused very minor damage, mainly to trees and some utility lines. Rainfall amounts were unusually light with less than one half inch reported at all official stations in south Florida.

The storm surge ranged from 3.3 feet above normal in Palm Beach County to 1.5 feet above normal in Miami-Dade County.  This caused mostly minor beach erosion.  Some locally moderate to heavy beach erosion was reported, especially in areas that had experienced high water from hurricane Dennis, two weeks earlier.  Other marine damage occurred to sea walls and small boats.  One brief tornado touched down in Boca Raton causing no damage.

The observed maximum wind speed was 53 mph at Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant in south Dade County with Fowey Rocks Light reporting sustained winds of 52 mph with a gust to 58 mph.  Most areas of south Florida reported maximum sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph with gusts near 40 mph.  The winds caused very minor damage, mainly to vegetation in the everglades.

Rainfall amounts were heaviest in Collier county with several reports of 10 inches in the Naples-Marco Island area which caused serious street flooding, but property damage was minimal. Rain estimates in mainland Monroe county were 6 to 10 inches.  Rainfall in other areas of south Florida was 1 to 3 inches.

The maximum storm surge was estimated at 1 to 2 feet along the southwest Florida coast causing minor flooding at Everglades City and minor beach erosion in Collier and mainland Monroe counties.  Two brief tornadoes touched down, one tearing the roof off of a residence in the Naples area.",384

Irene moved north across western Cuba on October 14 and strengthened to hurricane intensity early on October 15 in the Straits of Florida.  It then made its first landfall in south Florida in the lower Florida Keys around 9 AM EDT, October 15.  After crossing Florida Bay the center of Irene made landfall on the peninsula near Cape Sable around 4 PM EDT, October 15 as a Category One intensity hurricane.  It moved northeast across central Miami-Dade and Broward counties before exiting into the Atlantic just after midnight EDT on October 16 near Jupiter in northeast Palm Beach County.

Heavy rains and sustained winds of tropical storm force caused widespread flooding and power outages in the metropolitan areas of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.  The effects were similar, although somewhat more widespread, than those experienced in tropical storm Gordon in November 1994 and were reminiscent of the wet hurricanes in the 1930s and 1940s.

Rainfall totals in southeast Florida ranged from 6 to 17 inches with many areas getting 10 to 15 inches.  The greatest reliable amount reported was 17.45 inches at Boynton Beach.  The highest sustained wind over land was 60 mph at Miami Beach with many readings from 40 to 55 mph.  Fowey Rocks Light reported sustained winds of 66 mph while the Miami NWS doppler radar estimated areas of sustained hurricane force winds in the Atlantic Ocean just off the southeast Florida coast.  Among the highest recorded gusts were readings of 93 mph near Belle Glade, 85 mph at Homestead Air Reserve Base, 84 mph at Fowey Rocks Light, 74 mph at Turkey Point nuclear power plant and 70 mph at Miami International Airport.  The lowest barometric pressure on the south Florida peninsula was 989.9 mb at Opa Locka Airport.  Storm surge and beach erosion were minimal.

Four tornadoes touched down in Broward and Palm Beach counties, injuring 3 persons.  Several other areas of localized wind damage were reported, especially near the southeast shore of Lake Okeechobee, and were likely attributable to convective downbursts.

There were no direct deaths from Irene, but eight persons died in the aftermath.  Five persons were electrocuted by downed power lines, including three persons from one family.  Three other persons drowned in vehicle-related accidents.  Damage in southeast Florida, mainly from flooding is estimated near $600 million which includes $335 million in agricultural losses.  An estimated 700,000 customers lost electricity.  Flooding in a few residential areas lasted for a week displacing several hundred persons and isolating thousands more.

Other long-term ecological repercussions may be experienced from the flooding rains such as the effects of high water on Everglade's hammocks, and the effects of excessive fresh-water runoff on estuaries.",389

The swath was centered from Golden Beach to Opa Locka to Miami Springs to Sweetwater to West Kendall.  About 2 to 3 inches of the rain fell on October 2 and another 12 inches fell during the late afternoon and evening of October 3.  Flooding of  poorly drained urban areas quickly followed during the evening of October 3 and lasted into midday October 4.  Some flood waters lingered for up to a week.
